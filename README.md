# MNIST Image Classification

In this python notebook, we are creating a image classification model for the MNIST Image Datatset with `PyTorch`. 

# How to run the notebook?

It is quiet simple, if you using `Anaconda` then what you want to do is create a new environment using :

```Bash
conda create -n new_env_name
```

After this activate your newly created by:

```Bash
conda activate new_env_name
```

After activating the environment, do this. this will install all dependencies that are require to run the notebook.

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run the jupyter notebook and create the model. üëç
